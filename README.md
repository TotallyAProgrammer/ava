# Ava

## An adVanced Assistant

Ava is my new personal assistant.
My goal is to have an advanced assistant that will be just as capable as most modern personal assistants such as Alexa, Bixby, Google, and Siri.
I am choosing to make my own to decrease the tracking done on me and my data.

### Known Possible Issues

- Building SpeechRecognition is a pain because of PyAudio. <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio>
- Building PocketSphinx is a pain. You'll need:
  - pulseaudio-libs-devel
  - alsa-lib-devel
  - swig
  - gcc
  - python3x-devel (Where x is your version)
